                <p style="text-align: justify">The Kaghan Valley is at its best during summer (months ranging from May to September). In May the maximum temperature is 11 C (52 F) and the minimum temperature is 3 C (37 F). From the middle of July up to the end of September the road beyond Naran is open right up to Babusar Pass. However, movement is restricted during the monsoon and winter seasons. The Kaghan area can be reached by road via the cities of Islamabad or Peshawar.
The mountain ranges which enter Mansehra district from Kashmir are the offshoots of the great Himalayan system. In Kaghan valley the mountain system is the highest of the area including the Babusar top. This range flanks the right bank of the Kunhar, contains a peak Malika Parbat of over 17,000 feet (19), the highest in the district. On the mountains the grasslands are also found where Gujars and other nomads migrate during summer for grazing their sheep, goats and other animals. On the northern side there are mountains which are the extension of the same mountain system as that of Kaghan mountains. This range diverges from the eastern side at Musa-ka-Musalla a peak (13,378 feet) (20), which skirt the northern end of the Bhogarmang and Konsh valleys and sends down a spur to divide the two. Here also, like Kaghan, thick forests are found especially on the higher slopes. Due to extensive exploitation only in unapproachable areas the thick forests are found. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
From the middle of July up to the end of September the road beyond Naran is open right up to Babusar Pass. However, movement is restricted during the monsoon and winter seasons, but it can be closed anytime when the access is not cleared of snow. Portions of the road may be temporarily closed due to road work or inclement weather. This mountain pass is the highest Place of Kaghan Valley, that’s why it’s always covered with snow but in summer, snow melts so routes are cleared and it mostly rains there.  On the top of the pass there is a bridge like stony minaret, that is the symbol of the highest place of the area. At right side, there are snow covered peaks of Kashmir, while the north east gives an interesting view of Nanga Parbat.Only four wheeled cars can go ahead from Jalkhud, that’s why it takes 4 hours from Naran to reach Babusar Pass. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Babusar Top, the crossing point is 65 km from Naran city and 42 from the T-Junction near Chilas where it meets Indus River. Beware, the descend from Babusar Top towards Chilas side is very steep, one of the steepest that you might ever come across as you lose around 9000 ft in 42 km. Be very sure that the brakes of your vehicle are in perfect condition. Due to excessive use, the brakes usually heat up and therefore, period rest and minimum use of brakes (moving in 4x4 / low gear) is recommended. This portion is very accident prone. 
                  </p><p style="text-align: justify">
There are many shops at the top where one can get enough to eat though the rates are on the higher side. The drive through Babusar Pass is a unique experience which due to the top-quality road during recent years, has become quite doable. Highly recommended. Even if you are not going to Gilgit, just going to the top and coming back would be quite an event.
Due its unique location and the climb in elevation over thousands of feet, and passing through remote areas, it is important when driving in these conditions to be prepared. From the pass the whole panorama lies spread out before the visitor. On a clear day the great Nanga Parbat (26,660 ft) can also be seen from here. Although there are efforts to upgrade the road, most progress has been made on the Chilas side.
