                <p style="text-align: justify">Naltar Pass is a mountain pass to the north of Shani Peak in Naltar Valley in Pakistan. The pass lies west of Chaprot Pass and east of Hayal Pass. Hidden in the mountains a dramatic, barren gorge 19 km long is surprisingly green and lush valley of Naltar. Some climatic quirk gives Naltar about 410mm of rainfall per year, more than three times that of Gilgit and the valley is heavily wooded with pine, spruce, birch, rowan and juniper. Naltar altar village at 2800m has an army ski-training resort and is a good place to chill out and take a short easy trek around the valley. It is also starting point for two longer treks, one across the Naltar Pass 4600m to Ishkoman and the other across the Daintar Pass 4636m to Chalt, Naltar is a valley near Gilgit, Hunza and Nomal, Gilgit Baltistan in the Gilgit–Baltistan province of Pakistan. Naltar is 40 km from Gilgit and can be reached by jeeps.

Hunza valley is located in the northern area of Pakistan, this valley is one of the most beautiful place over the world and is a good touristic place, where tourists really enjoy their time and never become nervous. This is a mountainous valley, it gives spectacular scenery of the surrounding mountains like Ultar Sar, Rakaposhi, Bojahagur Duanasir II, Ghenta Peak, Hunza Peak, Passu Peak, Diran Peak and Bublimotin (Ladyfinger Peak), all 6,000 metres (19,685 ft) or higher. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
The Naltar Valley is a rarely visited, but beautiful valley just north of Gilgit. The drive from Gilgit to Naltar is dry and dusty, but as the road winds deeper into the valley, more and more greenery begins to show, finally revealing a small village nestled in meadows and pine trees below impressive peaks. Naltar is called “Little Switzerland” although the peaks that line the valley are bigger than anything in Europe. It is worth the effort to see the three Naltar Lakes. Each lake is a different color from bright green to amazing glacial blue. The lakes are a great place for a picnic. Trekkers can begin trekking from the lakes and the trail is easy to follow through the broad meadows beyond. After passing a few summer settlements, the trail begins to get a little rougher as it climbs higher. Soon the glacier comes into view and the only signs of life are a few stone shelters. Meadows cover the lower slopes of all the peaks and wildflowers are abundant…a great place to be a yak. Another day of trekking will bring you to the quiet village of Pakora in the Ishkomen Valley. From Pakora you can take a jeep back to Gilgit. The ancient people of Gilgit were hunters and Shepherds They lived in Wild areas they used meat and Butter as only food to survive. As the time reviled the people were developed and migrate toward the cities they learnt everything about the world until the day that they got their identity. </p>
                  <p style="text-align: justify">
Every tourist's journey to Naltar begins by leaving behind the Karakoram Highway at Gilgit for an adventurous two-hour jeep ride. The fact that cars can't be driven from Gilgit to Naltar is testament to the bumpy and somewhat arduous track. However, for those with the slightest clue of what beauty lies in the valley, the journey is simply part of the experience and is most certainly worth taking.
