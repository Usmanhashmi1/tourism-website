                <p style="text-align: justify">The Mintaka Pass or Mingteke Pass or Mintika Pass[ is a mountain pass in the Karakorum Mountains, between Pakistan and Xinjiang in China. In ancient times, the Mintaka Pass and the nearby Kilik Pass, 30 km (19 mi) to the west, were the two main access points into Gojal (Upper Hunza Valley) from the north. The Hunza Valley is the mountainous valley near Gilgit in Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan. In addition, the two passes were also the routes used to reach Chalachigu Valley and Taghdumbash Pamir from the south. The name of the pass – Mintaka means "a thousand goats" in Kyrgyz. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
The old and real silk route from China to India-subcontinent crossed the Mintaka Pass and came down the Misghar Valley to Hunza. A broad easy path still leads up through pastureland to this pass, ideal for a horse safari on the roof of the world. The pass is the central Asian watershed. Beyond it is the rolling high plateau of Central Asia.
Until the KKH was built across the Khunjerab Pass, the Mintaka Pass was the most popular route from Hunza to Tashkurgan; the KKH was built across the Khunjerab Pass because the Mintaka Pass lay too close the Afghan and then the Soviet borders. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Mintaka Pass is an international high mountain pass at an elevation of 4.450m (14,599ft) above the sea level, located between Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan and Xinjiang in China.Located in the Karakorum Mountains, the road to the summit is gravel, rocky, tippy and bumpy at times. The road is usually impassable from October to June (weather permitting). The pass is also known as Mingteke Pass or Mintika Pass. 4x4 vehicle required. Stay away if you're scared of heights. Expect a trail pretty steep. On the Chinese side, the entire valley around Mintaka Pass is closed to visitors. It has been off limits to foreigners since 1947. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Misgar village is set in a beautiful mountain environment of verdant, well-tended fields and clear streams irrigating the terraces and flower-covered gardens. The treks along the ancient trading routes, leading north to the Kilik and Mintaka Passes are equally attractive and could be rated as some of the easiest trekking in northern Pakistan. For more than 1000 years, Kilik and Mintaka were the Silk Routes’ primary passes between China and Hunza and today these broad valleys and extensive alpine meadows, once closed to foreigners, are again accessible. Kilik and Mintaka, two historic passes on Pakistan’s border with China, have been off limits to foreigners since 1947. The 1m-3m wide tails to these gentle passes are easy to follow, springs and trees are abundant, and camp sites are grassy, making this one of northern Pakistan’s easiest treks. Amongst the earliest travelers along the Silk Route were the pilgrims. A succession of Chinese monks, including Fah Hian, Sung- Yun and others made their way over the Wakhan passes to ancient Ghandhara (Swat), to receive holy Buddhist scriptures and eventually bring them back to China and Tibet. Whether those early pilgrims passed through Misgar is not clear; clear, however, is that a series of petroglyphs near Kilik, depicting horse riders, hunters, ibex and Buddhist swastikas, show evidence for the long and diverse human usage of this area.On the butte above Murkushi, a whole graveyard of old Kyrgyz tombs can be visited and stands as yet another reminder of Misgar’s long and fascinating past, at over 4,700 metres above sea level, this famed high mountain pass in the Karakorams just west of Khunjerab was used by travellers on the ancient Silk Route. In this picture, the pillar marks the border between China and Pakistan.
