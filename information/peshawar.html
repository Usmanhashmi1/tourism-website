                   <p style="text-align: justify">The old city demonstrates its age. In any case, a lot of its rubbish is regular of urban communities just extremely old, where western ideas of road cleaning and deny cleaning have for quite some time been deserted. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Be that as it may, if some manuals exhortation you to pursue your nose, there are not alluding to Peshawar's more odiferous rear ways and bazaars yet essentially utilizing a metaphor for interest. On the off chance that you do pursue youâ€™re extravagant you would not turn out badly regardless of whether you turn out to be pitifully lost. 
It's dubious if a cartographer could convey any coherent request to the city's labyrinth of roads, overhung with "Julliet" overhangs, back roads, and bazaars, yet on the off chance that just makes investigation the additionally captivating. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Try not to investigate via vehicle (the roads are definitely swarmed), however by walking or by rickshaw or tanga. Begin by traverse the Goal Bridge, between the objective and the Park Hotel. At that point transform left at the movement island into Khyber Bazaar where specialists, quacks, and cultivators tout their products, while advocates and kerbside letter scholars process the unlimited papers of the perpetual case procedures of Pakistan Law. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
End course you need to arrange a "grin field" of smiling grinds as you pick your way endless supply of bulletins showing blazing dentures and genuine examples on asphalts and in stands. 
At the activity lights just before the Kabul Gate police headquarters you can see the remaining parts of the old Kabul Gate between a segments of the old city dividers, while the outside of Lady Reading Hospital is really developed from the old dividers. 
Past this spot there is intersection. Transform left and you dive into Qissa Khawani Bazaar, Peshawar's mythical "road of story teller", which Sir Herbert Edwardes portrayed as "the Piccadilly of focal Asia". </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Bright natural products slow down and sweet shops jar for space along either side of the road together with wayside grills moving a confusing assortment of kebabs, barbecued meats, and newly prepared unleavened bread. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
The focal element of the tall, limited structures that line the bazaar are their wooden screens and carefully cut wooden overhangs and windows, from which hang the unavoidable bulletins or neon signs. 
For a considerable length of time, the pioneers of exchange parades and their specialists assembled in this bazaar and for installment in kind or money, would get one of the road's story tellers to recount a story of affection or brave, war or harmony. Today it's all the more a business than abstract venture. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Turn sharp left toward the finish of the bazaar and you enter the Copper-smith's Bazaar, where you will discover maybe Peshawar's most celebrated business person, "Poor Honest" Ali, encompassed by letters from rich and renowned, for example, Britain's Queen Elizabeth (II) and America's John Kennedy, Elizabeth Taylor, and so forth. Photos of him with world identities shaft from each point. Also, obviously, his finely-graven and beaten metal and copper-product glimmer beckoningly. 
Left, after the metal bazaar there is the Peshawar Pottery where consistently aside from on Fridays you can watch a specialist at his potter's wheel. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Back in the "Road of Story Tellers" you first go through the woolen bazaar, stacked with covers and shawls woven on pit lingers in Swat and Kaghan from hand-spun fleece with striking outskirts of embroidered artwork; and afterward you go to the Bird bazaar, trailed by the organic product bazaar and shops moving a wide range of chardars. Not a long way from here is the grain bazaar where there's a Pipal tree, accepted to be a branch of the tree under which Buddha lectured. </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
On to Chowk Yadgar of Peshawar which has generally been utilized for political gatherings, Peshawar's form of London's Hyde Park Corner, where the cash changer squat on floor coverings, and their safes behind them. Close-by is a landmark to the Pakistan legends who fell in the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war. 
West of the square is Andarshah Bazaar, the gems bazaar where you can locate some fine classical silver pieces, inborn adornments, military block a-brac, for example, old catches, clasps, and the regimental identifications, peaks and garbs of Russian troops in Afghanistan, and some not really valuable gemstones. 
There's additionally Peshawar's final Mughal mosque, the seventeenth century Mahabat Khan, named after the man who twice represented Peshawar under Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. Nearly annihilated by the fire that seethed through the Bazaar in June 1898, the mosque was spared, says a contemporary narrative, just by the "unremitting endeavors of the unwavering".  </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Amid the Sikh time an Italian general serving under Ranjit Singh every now and again utilizes its twin minarets as a substitute for the hangman's tree. Widely remodeled this century, the mosque, regardless, remains a fine case of Mughal engineering with a focal open patio and a petition lobby secured by three fluted arches. 
East of the square is Cunningham Clock Tower in Peshawar, worked to honor the precious stone celebration of Queen Victoria however named after Sir George Cunningham, the man who filled in as political specialist in North Waziristan, before getting to be Governor of the Province from 1937 to 1948, served an entire year after Pakistan's Independence.  </p> <p style="text-align: justify">
Close-by is the Meena Bazaar of Peshawar for ladies and, past that, a slope lined by houses worked of timber and crude block, considered more secure amid seismic tremor than those worked of prepared Brick. They have extravagantly cut, elaborate wooden entryways and galleries
